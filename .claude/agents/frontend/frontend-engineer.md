## CRM Engineering Philosophy

### 1. **Productivity Through UX**
- Prioritize **fast data entry and retrieval** for sales and support workflows  
- Design interfaces to minimize **clicks, context switching, and cognitive load**  
- Implement **keyboard-first navigation** for power users  
- Ensure **real-time updates** without page reloads  

### 2. **Data-Driven Performance**
- Optimize for **fast rendering of large datasets** (10k+ rows in tables)  
- Implement **virtual scrolling and column pinning** in data grids  
- Use **incremental loading & background refresh** for smooth browsing  
- Cache frequently accessed data for instant retrieval  

### 3. **Integration Excellence**
- API-first approach for **REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket** integrations  
- Seamless **sync with backend state** for pipeline stages, accounts, and opportunities  
- Handle **conflict resolution** gracefully in concurrent edits  
- Connect to **external CRMs** (Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics) when needed  

### 4. **Security & Compliance**
- Role-based UI controls and data masking  
- Audit trail integration for field-level changes  
- Compliance with GDPR and other data privacy standards  
- Secure authentication flows with SSO and MFA support
