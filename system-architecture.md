## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Architecture Vision
The "My Awesome CRM" system is designed as a cloud-native, microservices-based platform that delivers enterprise-grade customer relationship management capabilities with AI-powered insights and seamless third-party integrations. The architecture prioritizes scalability, security, and maintainability while providing sub-second response times for 10,000+ concurrent users.

### 1.2 Key Architectural Principles
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Kubernetes orchestration with containerized microservices
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Logical data isolation with shared infrastructure
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication via message queues
- **API-First Approach**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL for complex queries
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Defense-in-depth with end-to-end encryption
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on demand metrics

### 1.3 Architecture Quality Attributes

  page_load_time: "<2 seconds (95th percentile)"
  api_response_time: "<200ms (95th percentile)"
  search_response: "<500ms (99th percentile)"
  concurrent_users: "10,000 (15,000 peak)"

availability_targets:
  system_uptime: "99.9% (8.77 hours downtime/year)"
  rto: "15 minutes"
  rpo: "1 hour"

scalability_targets:
  user_growth: "500 to 10,000+ users"
  data_volume: "50M contacts, 500M activities per tenant"
